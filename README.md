Medium's Article 1 - Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN)

This repository contains the code necessary to output the graphs included in my first Medium article. 
In this repository, one can find three files: a file with R code, and two files with Python code. 
The Python code is saved in two different file formats: .py and .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)


Notice that the Python code requires the library "rpy2.robjects". This is needed to obtain the 
same random uniform observations, which are obtained in the R file. This way, we get the same results 
in both graphs.
